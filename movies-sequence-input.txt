Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Cameron.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Why?
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
That's because it's such a nice one.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
There.
You got something on your mind?
You have my word.  As a gentleman
How do you get your hair to look like that?
Sure have.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
She's not a...
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Hi.
You know Chastity?
Have fun tonight?
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
I was?
Well, no...
Then that's all you had to say.
But
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
do you listen to this crap?
What crap?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
What good stuff?
The "real you".
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
No
Wow
She okay?
They do to!
Did you change your hair?
No.
Where did he go?  He was just here.
Who?
Great
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Is he oily or dry?
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
It's more
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Queen Harry?
Neat...
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Hi, Joey.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
Where've you been?
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
What do you think?
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
What's normal?
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
You are so completely unbalanced.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
Like you care.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
What?
In 9th.  For a month
Why?
He was, like, a total babe
But you hate Joey
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
You did what?
But
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
Why didn't you tell me?
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
That's not
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
Let go!
You set me up.
I just wanted --
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
Patrick -- is that- a.
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
What if she never starts dating?
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
But she doesn't want to date.
Daddy, I --
And where're you going?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
Oh, God.  It's starting.
Wear the belly before you go.
Daddy, no!
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Why?
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
The prom?  Kat has a date?
No, but
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
I'm missing something.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
Never
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
You the new guy?
So they tell me...
So -- which Dakota you from?
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirty-two.
Get out!
How many people go here?
That I'm used to.
That girl -- I --
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Who is she?
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Why not?
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
He always have that shit-eating grin?
You know French?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
What about him?
What makes you think he'll do it?
He seems like he thrives on danger
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
I thought you hated those people.
You got him involved?
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Will Bogey get bent?
Number one.  She hates smokers
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
He's pretty!
Assail your ears for one night.
You told me that part already.
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
What've you got for me?
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Cameron, I'm a little busy
What 're you talking about?
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
Sure
What'd you do to her?
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
You makin' any headway?
She kissed me.
What's the worst?
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
Hey -- do you mind?
Where ya goin?
Away.
Leave my sister alone.
Yeah
Two legs, nice rack...
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
You just said
You need money to take a girl out
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
I'm on it
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I just upped my price
What?
A hundred bucks a date.
Forget it.
It's about time.
How'd you do it?
Do what?
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
Hey.
Are you lost?
Nope - just came by to chat
We don't chat.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
Does this conversation have a purpose?
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
You and Verona?
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
Who's that?
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
He always look so
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
What's this?
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
William would never have gone to a state school.
William didn't even go to high school
That's never been proven
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
Does it matter?
You think this'll work?
What'd he say?
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
I didn't have a choice.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
You didn't
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Have you seen him?
Who?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
Pick you up Friday, then
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
You hate me don't you?
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
And why would I do that?
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
You -- covered in my vomit.
Are you following me?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
You're not a big talker, are you?
hey.  Great show, huh?
Excuse me?
That's what you want, isn't it?
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
You know who The Raincoats are?
What's this?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Okay?
You're not okay.
I just need to lie down for awhile
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I know, just let me sleep
This is so patronizing.
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Why 're you doing this?
I told you
You don't care if I die
Sure, I do
Why?
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Like you could find one
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Why'd you let him get to you?
Who?
Dorsey.
I hate him.
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
I thought you were above all that
Kat! Wake up!
And I'm in control of it.
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
Busy
Were you in jail?
Maybe.
No, you weren't
Then why'd you ask?
I should do this.
Do what?
Start a band?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
Oh, so now you think you know me?
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Who?
BIANCA
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
What are you doing here?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so --
Wholesome.
Unwelcome.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
So what did I have an effect on ?
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Put your right foot there --
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
The Partridge Family?
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
Good call.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
A soft side? Who knew?
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
So what's your excuse?
Acting the way we do.
Yes
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Something like that
Then you screwed up
How?
You up for it?
State trooper?
Fallacy.
The duck?
Hearsay.
Tell me something true.
I hate peas.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
What?
No one else knows
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Is that a request or a command?
You know what I mean
No.
No what?
No, I won't go with you
Why not?
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You tell me.
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
Answer the question, Patrick
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's just something I had.  You know
Oh huh
My grandmother's .
What?
That ' s completely adorable!
Wait I...
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
It wasn't like that.
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
Is that right?
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Because I like to torture you.
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
I know.
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
My insurance does not cover PMS
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.
Why can't we agree on this?
Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right
So what I want doesn't matter?
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
Was that your sister?
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
No, Daddy.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Parts of it.
Which parts?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Bianca did what?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
When I go?
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
Tempestuous?
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
Hi.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
You think?
Macbeth, right?
Right.
Kat a fan, too?
Say it
What?
What plan?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
What?!
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
Ever been to Club Skunk?
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
So you got cozy with she who stings?
You were right. She's still pissed.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
I missed you.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
Touch of the flu.
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
What's to discuss?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
You're completely demented.
In the microwave.
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Tumescent!
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
Have a great time, honey!
What just happened?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Did I have anything to say about it?
Absolutely not.
Hi!
Yes?
Oh, now, that's a great one!
You like it?
Bravo!
This is my new friend...
I'm Adam Webber.
We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
You're kidding!
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
Your mom was a dancer?
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
How do you do?
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
Come where?
My office.
For how long?
Well, that depends...
Let's go talk first, Adam.
The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!
How do you do?
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
Please excuse this interruption.
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
What?!
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
Bon soir, mademoiselle!
Are you French?
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
Get out of here!
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
Where are we going?
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
No, I'm lost.
You're lost?
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
Dickhead?
What's wrong with you?
I just had a mental picture of...
I came on a bus.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
Oh, that's nice.
So far?
Yes, I'm right?
Right.
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Again.
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
It was amazing.
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
Do you own a car?
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
You don't?
Nope.
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
Rogers Hornsby?!?
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
Yes.
And that's it?
Yes.
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
Heck, no!  What?!
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
Wait!  Wait!
What is it?!
It's Perry!
Perry?
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
How's that?
Oh, I could die...
Over this?
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
Hey, what are you doing?!
Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
I am so glad to see you!!  I thought I'd never see you again!
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
I can't, it's yours.
Take it. damn it!
Why are you doing that?
I haven't brushed yet.
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
No.
Thank-Q!
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
I think it's the eyes.
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Watching television in color.
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
See, ya.
Why doesn't it never work out?
What?
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
...Okay.
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
Why not go to work for me?
Doing what?
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
How long would you need me?
Two weeks.
What's the pay?
What's fair?
You got it! Wait here while I change.
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
They like Dr. Pepper.
Who are these people?
My Mom and Dad.
Very funny, smart ass.
Wait! Wait!
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
I guess we'll need another locker.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
Thank you.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Okay.
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
Name it.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Then forget it.
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
This is for me.
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
A wife?
Yes.
What for?
Because I want to get married.
Why?!
I don't want to be alone.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
Bites what?
The big one!
It does?
Sure.
I didn't know that.
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
They're all divorced?
Everybody's divorced.
It didn't used to be that way.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
One who's not a mutant.
No dogs, huh? Okay.
When do you need her by?
Two weeks.
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
Could we talk about that a little later?
Of course.
Get out!
Now, get out!!
Yes, ma'am!
Stop that ma'am crap!
You almost got us killed!
I told you I've never driven before!
Never drive again!
You said it would be easy!
I was wrong!!
Is this your house?
Yes!
Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
Thank-Q!
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
Um-hum.
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
Yes!
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.
Where's he gone?
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
He has a computer?
Sure.
In the house?
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
May I please be excused?
All right.
The what?
The guy with the underpants!
About clothing?
Yeah.
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
Hey, Eve!
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
I certainly do!
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
No it's not!
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
My goodness gracious!  This place is something!
No!  Not crazy!
Do I look crazy?
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
I thought I was here to meet women.
Not that one!
I like her.
What have you ordered?
What about her?
No way.
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
Okay. I like that.
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
Really?
That's ridiculous.
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
What?
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
You wanted to see me!
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
Adam?!
I don't blame you!
I'm leaving, too.
But, Eve, I would--
Eve?!
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
I'm really sorry!
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
I know...and I'm really sorry.
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
What?
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
I know first aid!
There.
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
Is that what you call it?
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
Sing it to me.
Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
Uh-huh. Adam?
Yes, Eve?
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
My pleasure.
It was at least as good as the sky.
Really?  Okay!
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
Hi, Eve!
Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
...I do.
No.
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
Is that a birthday cake?!
Yes, it is.
Is this because of the radiation?
What?
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
A card?
Yes, sir.
Are you all right?
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
Yes.
I've got to go, now.
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
How do I leave here?
The front door is open.  Will you be back?
I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an "investment."  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
Tempus fugit!
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roul!
Gerade aus dann links!
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
These are wonderful.
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
What's baseball?
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
Like a painting?
No, son. A pitcher.
Like one of Mom's?
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
The nocturnal flying mammal?
No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!
Why?
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
Then why go there?
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
Oh, boy! A jacket!
Your mom made that all by herself.
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
Well, do we just go on up?!
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
C'est bon, Monsieur.
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
Yes, father?! Yes?
...the pipe tobacco.
Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore."
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
I promise. Is that all?
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
But, I don't understand.
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Uh-huh.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
You're sure?
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
That's what everybody believes?
Yes, sir. It's true.
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!
Uh, I think they have.
You have very nice ceilings.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Not particularly.
Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
I love Lucy!
It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
And it's called...?
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
Right on the button.
That's right?
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?
1959.
Who use to own it?
Russia.
When did we get it from them?
1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
What's the capitol?
Juneau.
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
This must be very new.
Yeah.
It's so small.
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
I don't think so.
You don't have a computer in your cabin?
No.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
That would knock my father out.
Yeah?
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Yes. He likes windows.
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
Not on him.
I'm not wearing his pants.
Why not? He has great pants.
I just don't want to.
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
Almost all of them.
The recovery is very impressive.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
That's why little things mean so much to him.
Why did you park way back there?
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
What?!
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
You bet!
So, did you buy a movie?
What?
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Does that work?
Good-bye, Adam.
Bye, Troy!
Bye, Adam!
And thanks for always being happy!
You dial nine to get out.
Of what?
The hotel.
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
My father is a genius.
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
How old are you?
Thirty-five.
You don't look thirty-five.
How old do I look?
Twenty-five? Around there.
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
What?  What is it?!
The sky!!!
The sky?  Where?
Up there!!
I don't see anything!
Help you?
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
Sure.
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
Whatcha looking at?
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Say what?!
How do you do, ma'am.
I do alright.
Hello.
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
Oh, that would be wonderful!
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
Oh. A nice one, I hope.
Elbows, Son.
Sorry, Mom!
Dad!
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
I'm afraid you've got to.
I'll be all right.
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
Right.
I just hope this is still good up there.
Yes?
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
Yes, ma'am.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
Are you in trouble, son?!
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
Mom?  Eve and I have to go.
What?
We have to go.
This is your bedroom?
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Well, where are you --
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
No.
Oh, my God!
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
What about relatives?
All back East.
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
He drank it hot?
Yeah.
Good god.
You got a light, honey?
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
Really?
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
Well, put it down and come in!
I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
It's time.
It shuts off automatically.
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
No.  They all do.
You hear that?!
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
How long will we have to stay down here?
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
Days??
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
Yes, dear!
Home sweet home!
What's that noise?
The locks.
The locks?
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
Thirty -five years!
Then after that it's safe.
To go up.
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
No.
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
I'm not hungry.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
Would you like a tranquilizer?
You have tranquilizers?
Oh, no.
What?
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Is there a problem?
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
I've noticed.
No.  I think it's just right.
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
Yes!
If I...you know...
Calvin?!
Right here!
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Why?
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Watch this!
Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
Hi, honey!
Calvin!
Get the presents and do the lights.
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
What did you wish for, Adam?
If he tells, it won't come true!
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Let's eat our cake.
If we still have one.
Yes...
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
Would you excuse me?
In the generator room again?
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
Should we say a little prayer first?
Yes, yes it is!
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
Mutants?!
Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
No.
Yes.
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
We stay down here.
We do?
Yes.
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
Well, I am the head of this household--
I want him to at least see the sky!
--and we will--
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
He's smart.
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.
How long will you set it for this time?
I thought ten years.
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
Some time.
What are you bitching about now?
What are you doing here?
I forgot some of my stuff.
You came back for these?
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
So where is your roommate, the model?
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
Stop it, you two!
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
I knew you'd like him.
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
Oh, yes.
Give me your hand.
But first, you have to start with the clothes!
I don't know.
You're serious, aren't you?
What's that supposed to mean?
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
Well, that's blunt!
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
I see "elegant."
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
Alright, I will.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
Well, what do you think?
I think...it...works.
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
That water's freezing!
Just be yourself.
Always good advice.
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
Eve?!
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
Um... Eve?
Go to the bathroom.
He go back to the hotel?
What's that mean?
We did not leave together.
What's it to you?!
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Those sluts!
Where are you going?
To bed.
To bed?
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.
Yes, you do.
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
Uh, yes, you do.
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
Yes, you do!
Or have perfect table manners.
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
What?
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
Where did he get all that information?
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
He didn't leave with them.
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
He left with Sophie.
What?!!
It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
I don't think so.
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
Oh, no!
Gay.
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
What do you want to do with it?
Give it back to him.
And if we can't find him?
What's wrong?
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
Have him committed.
Yeah! That's thinking.
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
I don't know. I like to think so.
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
To get some frozen poultry.
Then what?
We came back to the house!
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
What?!
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
Adam!!
Where?!
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
Buy it from me?
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
Wolf One -- say intentions.
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
Tower, say again!!
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
The fuck was that?
Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.
It's Christine.  Hey you.
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
So what's up?
Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
Well, then put him at the singles table.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
Why are you being so defensive?
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
Bye.
I love you.
Miles.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
How's the trip?
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
And?
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
Huh.
Are you there? Miles?
Yeah, I'm here.
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
So I guess that's it.
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
Gary.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
My condolences.
What are you pouring tonight?
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
What do you think?
How's it hanging, Miles?
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
Highliner.
Glass or bottle?
Bottle.
You got it.
Say, is Maya working?
You okay, Miles?
They're from both of us.
Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.
They're just leftovers.
Is it chicken?
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
Two years ago, buddy.
She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Hey, guys. How's it going?
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
Stephanie.
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
Oh yeah.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
Sure I know Maya. Real well.
You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
Good. How're you?
Great. You look great.  You both do.
I'm thinking about the duck breast.
What happened to you guys?
Hi.
I can explain.
Hiya.
Highliner, please.
Are you a writer too?
No, I'm an actor.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
Anything I'd know?
That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
I am one of those guys.
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
No, we're paying for the wine.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
I can't help the traffic.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
You said you had it all lined up.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Yeah, Conundrum.
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
Don't open that now. It's warm.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
Shut up.  Here's to a great week.
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
Yeah.
Oh, that's tasty.
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
Just tell me.
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
And?
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
Oh yeah. Much better.
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
Whoa, why are we getting off?
I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
What?
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
How old's she going to be?
Um... seventy... something.
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
That's your problem, Miles.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
I'd rather have a knife.
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
You still seeing that shrink?
I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
And Lexapro, yes.
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
I told you. Filet and salmon.
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
Let me call Christine.
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
This is rose, right?
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
What color is it supposed to be?
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
Huh.
What do you smell?
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
That's what you do with every one.
When do we get to drink it?
How would you rate this one?
You know, you could work in a wine store.
Are you chewing gum?
Hey Jack, hurry up!
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
It's not even a mile.
We should have driven.
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
Whoa.
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
So you're going to stop acting?
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
Uh-huh.
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
If that's what feels right.
It does. Feels right.
Then it's a good thing.
Yeah. Tight.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
You know her?
Sure I know Maya.
You know that chick?
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
She is very hot.
Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
And she likes Pinot.
Perfect.
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
She works for tips!
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
How do you know?
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
Shut up.
Have you no shame?
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
So what's the plan today?
I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
Nice, huh?
Beautiful.
Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
Miles.
She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
She what?  When?
About a month ago. Six weeks.
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
I want to go home now.
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
What do you think?
You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
Get the trunk.
We're on.
What?
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
With Maya?
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
Well, she is cute.
You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
So what should I wear?
Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
Aye-aye, captain.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
Pull yourself together, man.
Where were you?
Bathroom.
Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on!
Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.
Shut up. Shut your face.
Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
We were supposed to play golf.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
Count me out.
Later.
Oh, boy.
She's been leaving messages here too.
You should call her.
I will.  See ya!
Right now.
What'd Christine say?
Hey, there you are.
Yep.
Where is Stephanie?
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
What the fuck are you doing?
What?
Does she know about Saturday?
Besides what?
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
What?
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep.
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
Understanding of what?
Like I might be in love with another woman.
In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
Look who's talking. You've been there.
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
What? Of course I like Christine.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
That was three years ago after that first party!
Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
Call me on my cell if you go out.
That's a public course.  No Stephanie?
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
Nope.
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
Can you give me some room here?
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
Nice shot.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
Nope.
What do you think's going on?
Could be anything.
Been checking your messages?
Obsessively.
Huh.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
Shut up.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
What is it?
Fucker hit into us.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.
I don't want to talk about it.
Is it the money thing?
Is what the money thing?
With Maya.
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
Slaughterhouse.
We're on.
What's happening?
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
What exactly are we going to do?
I said okay?
You have to tell me --
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
No.
What?
It's private.
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
You didn't get any, did you?  You're a homo.
Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  I want to go home.
Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
Do you like them?
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
I don't have to.
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
Let me use your phone.
What's up?
Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
What's that supposed to mean?
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
Thanks.
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
Well?
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
That's thoughtful.
So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.
Huh. Let me think.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
What's it look like to you?
You know what I'm thinking?
What's that?
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
Fucking chick's married.
What?
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
That's five clicks, Jackson.
We gotta go back.
What?
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
No way. No way.
Please, Miles, please.
She tell you she was married?
Yeah.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
So what's the plan?
The plan is... you go.
Me?
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
Hey, Jack. Jack.
Hrnrnrn?
Yep. Quite a day.
Want me to drive?
No, I'm okay.
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
Come on, let me drive.
I'm fine. You rest.
What's wrong?
What the fuck!
You said it looked like a car accident.
What the fuck!
Look at this!
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
You broke some.
Whatever. Sorry.
Well. That about does it.
Why don't you come in?
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Love you, man.
Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
Maya, how are you?
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
You want to join us?
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
I finished it.
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.
What are you drinking?
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Oh yeah? How is it?
Nice. Very nice.
Twelve months in oak.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
I'm having the salmon.
Are you all right?
Hi.
Hey.
She got anything good?
So what gems do you have in your collection?
Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
Yeah, I know.
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
How long have you been into wine?
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
What was the bottle that did it?
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
Is she sleeping or...?
You got kids?
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
Yeah, weird. But great.
So what's your novel about?
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
What's the title?
"The Day After Yesterday."
Oh. You mean... today?
Um... yeah but it's more...
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
Yeah. Thanks.
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
A paper?
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Well...
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Sure.
I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
What about me?
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
Yeah? Like what?
Bathroom over there?
You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
Got it.
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Good. So did I.
Okay. See you around.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Hope you like it. Feel free to stop reading at any time. I'll take no offense.
Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
I had class.
Well, nice to see you now.
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
About two-thirty.
Okay.
No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
Were you ever going to say anything?
Maya.
I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Oh, Maya. No.
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
Hello?
Victoria.
Victoria! How the hell are you?
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
Where are you?
Hello?
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
Ken.
Ken.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --
Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.
That was big of him.
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
That's great.
So how're you doing?
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
So what's happening with your book?
Universally rejected. Strike three.
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
I am.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
Not me. I'm not drinking.
You quit drinking?
I'm pregnant.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
See you over there, Miles.
How much skin and stem contact?
About four weeks.
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
About a year.
French or American?
Both.
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
Sir, what are you doing?
I told you I need a drink.
So what do you think?
Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
Should we get dessert?
Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
That was fun last night.
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
Where's Jack?
So what are you up to today, Miles?
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
Huh.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
Oops. Sorry.
You golf?
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
See you, Miles. You take care.
Stephanie! Stop!
A famous actor who's getting married next week.
It was a surprise, Mom.
You talked to Wendy?
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
Miles, when are you going to get married again?
Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?
What?
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
I'll try to be more careful.
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
The thing's kind of heavy.
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
No, I just meant...
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
So you admit it?
Well, uh, can you tell us his name?
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
No harm, no foul?
Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
You sent that?
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
I'm asking you to leave.
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Stop it!
Gay? He said you were gay?
He implied it.
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
Yeah, but he was successful.
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
Good-looking?
What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump.  Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.
Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
It must be great with a wife like that.
Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
Nah.
Never?
Mary again.
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
Whatever happened to Mary?
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
I mean since then.
I don't know.
Well why don't you look her up?
Yeah, right.
Why not?
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
You're kidding? What did they say?
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
I don't know about this, Dom.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
His mother?
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
And you think he could find out her number for me?
That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never procrastinate about anything again. Life is too fucking short.
Hey, look on the bright side --
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Well... at least now you know.
What's so funny?
Wait a second, I never told you that.
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Never met him.
Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
Mary's a babe!
What?
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
Huh? But why did Healy?
No You mean...?
Uh-huh.
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
Well then you've got to call her, man.
You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?
I am?
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
How the hell did you get here anyway?
Shoot.
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
And this adversely affects me how...?
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
Well? What are you waiting for?
I don't know what to say.
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man.
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Got cash.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Check.
Mints?
Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.
Hm?
You know, clean the pipes.
Pipes? What are you talking about?
Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
Why's that?
Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will.
Huh.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
Jesus Christ you're right.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
Dom? What are you?
Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
So... I see you made the news.
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
Uh-huh. Where was he?
Out getting coffee.
Bob, do you remember Mary?
Who?
Mary.
A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?
Who?
Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser.
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed up.
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
'That right?
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
We're in love with your roommate.
Healy you dog!
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
Here's the info you asked for.
Thanks.
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
Stalker, huh?
Very nice.
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Take it easy, that's Bill.
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
Nineteen months I been sober.
What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Here, just have one of these then.
Healy, what I just tell you?
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
Am I?
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
Hello...? Sully...?  Sully, that you?
Who the fuck is it to you?
Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
So where the hell are you, Healy?
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
The sawbones?
Oh yeah.
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did.  I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy. You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections.
Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
Nepal? Have you been?
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
You own a home there?
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
Same here again.
By the way, what's your name?
Don't you want to know my name?
I already know it, Mary.
How'd you know that?
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
Some buildings I'm working on.
Are you... an architect?
I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
What's that?
I work with retards.
I beg your pardon?
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
No, I mean
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
-- He's in a cage?!
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
That sounds like fun.
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now?
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
Fine. Fine.
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
We will, but first I have a surprise.
A surprise?
I know he's around here someplace.
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
Deco.
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
That...? Vestibule.
How about -- ?
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
And it doesn't cramp your style?
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
Lint?
You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
You're a movie buff?
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
Have you seen it?
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
A fucking moron.
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
Yeah.
So...
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
I guess.
Mary ah, forget it.
What?
No, forget it, it was stupid.
Come on, what were you going to say?
Fuck!!
Turn it up, Magda.
All set.
How's my stomach taste, she says.  Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.
Urrggghh...
Are you okay?
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP.
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school.
Uh-huh.
Any idea where I might start looking?
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
All you want is a phone number?
Well, I know you're busy...
Don't play games with me, Ted.
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
I don't buy it.
Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up?
No.
She's blackmailing you, right?
No.
You want her dead, don't you?
You can't be serious.
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend.
I think your life's about to change.
So you found Mary?
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
So she hasn't changed?
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
No, not at all.
Mary's a little chubby, huh?
But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.
So she's married?
Nope. Never been.
Huh?
Four kids, three different guys.
Three different guys?
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Oh my.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Uh, that's okay.
What are you doing?
Miami?
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
Jai alai?
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.
Good good.
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
All the same, I still want to call her. I know it sounds crazy -- Mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life -- but, I don't know, maybe I can help her out.  The poor thing's had it tough -- she's in a wheelchair for Godsakes.
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from Japan.
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
Mary's a mail-order bride?
Hey, hey, hey!
You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?
What do you mean 'why'?
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
Do what?
Turn her over to a stalker.
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
Oh Christ... poor dog.
You're a sick man, you know that?
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
Your turn?
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
Mainly I work out of Boston.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
Harvard?
You bet.
Did you study under Kim Greene?
Among others.
Kim and I are close friends!
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
You know, I really should take your card.
Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.
That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?
You what?
I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
What do you mean?
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn.
And you met Mary how?
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
How'd you manage that one?
Friend. Baseball bat.
Nice.
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
How many is that?
Four.
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
Ho-ly shit.
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
You little fuck.
What?
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
You were following us?
Oh... Sully.
Thanks for picking me up.
No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
That must make it tough.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
Oh. Well I am.
Hm?
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
'That right? Good for you.
Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
I see where you're going.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
I'd go with the seven.
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
How do you guarantee that?
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
I can live with those reflections.
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you're too hard on guys.
No I'm not.
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in Miami.  Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.
Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.
Have you been up all night again?
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
Meaning?
Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
Jesus, Mary, you gotta hear this -- some cop's staking out this broad's apartment.
So who's the lucky guy?
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
Good lookin'?
What's he like?
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
What's a mook?
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
I don't watch the new ones.
This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits.
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
Bundt cake?
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
I'm buying bananas tonight.
Why?
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
An old flame?
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
Holy shit...
Magda!
Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
Where's Puffy?
Pat's an architect, too.
Pat does projects all over the world.
What's up, Doc?
You don't think they're too big?
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
Not long at all, but I really like him.  Okay, I know he's a little different, Tucker, but that's what I like about him. He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always politically correct and he probably farts, too. And that's okay with me.
That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
Can I pour you one?
What's up?
I think you'd better sit down.
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
What...?
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there.
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
Oh yeah. Fine.
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
No, it's an old football injury.
Oh, are you on the team?
Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds.
So who you taking to the prom?
Huh?
The prom -- you going?
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
Hi, Ted.
I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Are you all right?
Ted, are you okay?
Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?
You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?
Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
And did everything -- ?
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
Really? I never got a message.
By the way, how's he doing?
He's dead.
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
Oh. So... what brings you down here?
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Oh... are you... ?
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
Hey.
Hi, Ted.
You look great.
What's that?
Hm?
Sure.
Now by killer, you mean...?
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
What are you?
Twenty-two.
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
Nitrate-sicles -- I like that.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver.
I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.
Yeah?
Well... why don't you move back?
So you're a writer?
Trying to be.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Ted... you're not that far ahead.
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
Why not?
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom.
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
Get out.
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
That you put a murderer on my trail?
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
Please leave.
Mary, come on...
Go!
Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school.
What what are you doing here?
Ted...?
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
But but what about Steve?
Get over here.
Really?
Yeah? What do you want?
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you doing?!
What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?
I, uh... I got it stuck.
You got what stuck?
It.
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
Shhhhhh!
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
What?! No please, sir --
Is it the frank or the beans?
One guess.
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted. Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a joke a minute.
Teddy, hon, are you okay?  OH HEAVENS TO PETE!
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
What do you mean?
No, no, please!
Ho there.
Oh God.
Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?
I wasn't trying --
Well, there's only one thing to do.
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
No! I was pissing!
Hey.
So what's up?
Eh.
It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you want.
See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
Uh-huh.
Okay.  So is that a yes or a no?
Piggyback ride.
We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?
Franks and beans!
How are you doing, Warren?
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
See you, Warren.
See you, Warren.
What the hell was that?
Sorry.
No, it was good.
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
I'll do it.
Good work, Ostreicher.
Thanks coach.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!
Sorry, coach.
Great evening, isn't it?
Sure.
What did you just say?
Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova.
Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
...okay...
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
Good morning gentleman.
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for letting us have a great party.
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
All right, I got some scotch.
Single malt?
So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
I had no idea you'd be this good!
This is your plan, Finch?
This.  Right now.
Of course, Finch.  What?
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
What are we gonna hear?
You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
What do you suppose they're saying?
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Just go!
Why is this?
You're gonna shit your pants!
Charming.
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
Me too.  For the most part.
I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
Not bad, Chris.
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
Oh sure.  I know what people think. It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- I also play football, by the way -- But that's like...not <u>all</u> that I am.
Of course, I didn't --
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
Yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?
Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
Hey, what're you doing here?
Um...Chris --
You can call me Oz.
Do I have to?
You can call me Ostreicher.
What's your middle name?
Forget it.
Come on!  I won't tell.
Neither will I.
Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
Nice car.
I'm glad you think so.
You don't like it?
What?!
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
What?  No I'm not.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
I wasn't making fun of you.
Why are you doing this?
Because I want to.
Hi...
How did you know I was here?
Stifler told me.
You talked to Stifler?
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
Uh...my dad's the manager.
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
That's nice.
So you're going to Michigan?
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
Onions?
What?
You want onions?
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
I know.  Salt and pepper?
So we're gonna be close next year?
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
You can't sing at the competition.
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
What about the game?!
I'm not playing.
You're missing the game for us?!
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
What's that?
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
This isn't any better, Chris.
Oz, it's okay, I know.
You called me Oz.
Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!
I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
Yeah right.
What?  We both have cars.
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
That's not why we're going out.
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
He likes it.
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
I think I've had one.
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
...I've never tried it.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.
What?
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
You mean...and orgasm?
You got it, stud.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
No you haven't.
But that one time --
No.
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
Do you?
Of course.
I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
No comment.
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Did you guys hook up or something?
Are you kidding?  No.
Then what the hell are you talking about?
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.
I don't get it, that really works?
Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.
Give it to me!  Yes!
Don't you love my sexy body?!
You're so big!
Fuck me!  Yes!
And you said...
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
You think she was serious?
There's our man.
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five after.
You can crash at Stifler's?
At least now I know what the hell they're saying.
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
Gotta go.
Ow, what the hell?
Like a bet?
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
Pontificated.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
Right.  That gives us...
I have no idea.  Finch showers in a bathing suit.
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
Hey, where's Finch?
Went home to shit.
You can send me the address too.
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
Did I miss anything?!
But, but -- what would I do?
Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
That's stupid.
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
Please, God.  Let this be it.
Holy shit.
Hey, minuteman.
How do you know that?
Yeah?  Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good.
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse.  Jim?
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
Back out?  You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid.  You afraid or something?
Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
What the heck is this?
Can I come in?
Yeah, sure.
You're not...busy?
Okay.
I know, Dad.
Dad!  I know!
Do you know about the clitoris?
Yes dad.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Jim?
Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
Yes.
Son.  This lady's here for you.
Dad.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
Dad!!
Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
What was your name again?
Michelle.
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Yes.  Seriously.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
Whatever you want.
You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
I told you.
Yeah, bring it on!
So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
Okay, I get it.
...excuse me?!
This'll do.
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
Don't you want me to?
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
She's a mermaid, dude.
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
You guys got the Latin homework?
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
This was remade?  Into what?
Who cares?
Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
You can do that?
You've still got a chance with Nadia, right?
I still think you're okay.
There it is.  I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date.
I'll just say that we had a great night together.
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
It's true.  I mean, after this, everything'll be different.
After getting laid?
What's up, fellas?
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
You've got something going?
You did it.
Yes.
No...you...go...ahead.
You are very good in the world history class, yes?
Yes.  No.  Yes.
Okay...that would be cool sometime.  How 'bout tomorrow?
Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?
So you need to change, right?
James!  You have come in here on purpose?!
Well...uh...
Shame on you!
Uh...yeah...sorry.
Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
Strip?
You mean like, <u>strip</u> strip?
Uh...
Move with the music.
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
Nadia, I can't --
Jim...
You are done, James.  Perhaps I should be going now.
Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
No, not again.
I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
Stifler, you're such an asshole.
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
God dammit, Stifler!
Ho-lee shit.
Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
"Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."
Kevin, this is serious!
Oh, Kev.
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
Tonight?
Let me know.
Vicky, wait.
I was being selfish.  And majorly insensitive.  And I'm a total idiot.
I think "shithead" really says it.
And I want to try to make it up to you.
Oh...ungghhhhh!
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
That's my trick!
We've come a long way since Homecoming.
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
Like how?
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
I think you're so right, Kevin.
You want to do it?
Kevin?  Do you not love me?
No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
But you don't love me.
Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Hey...
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
About the other day...I've been thinking.
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Now?!
See -- this is the nicest room.
You comfortable?
Yeah, are you?
You sure you're comfortable?
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Yeah.
Me too.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?
I don't know.  How do you?
Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
Yeah Vick?
I want to hear you say it.
Victoria...I love you.
That was a great night.
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
What?
You called me to ask me how to get laid?
What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
Just dial 976-Asshole.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
Have you ever heard of the bible?
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
Does it tell me how to get laid?
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Ready for what?
Say that again, Kevin?
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
What?!  How do I do that?
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
Qualify for what?
Hey.  I got another question for you.
Then she said -- she loves me.
You ever hear of something called The Bible?
Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide --
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
Contact, dude.
Feeling better, Oz?
I'm such a loser.
I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong.
Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
Dude, prom sucks.
So does your tongue cramp up?
What reputation?
Okay, explain.
Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
Kevin, it was just a --
...Guess what?
And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
NOVA!!
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
That junior chick?
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
Bullshit.  From where?
She works part-time at my dad's store.
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
I think you need your balls reattached.
Keep it down, dude.
What the fuck are you doing here?
You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
<u>Yeah</u>!
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
Our last game is this Saturday.
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
Here, babe.
Really?
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
I didn't know you had a secret admire.
Huh?
There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
It lets a crazy man into our lives.
You're not still writing that thank-you note?
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...
Go ahead.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
What is it you want? What?
How was it talking to him?
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Call me as soon as you're settled.
Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
I'm sorry.
Don't be silly. How bad?
Hi...  Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
He's good...  And I'm an expert on doctors.
Do you love me?
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.  She says I have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work. What work do you do?
How long has he been having problems?
Since forever.
Have they done blood tests on him?
Yes.
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
Emergency room only.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
No.
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
It's amazing these things weren't done.
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
Me. My home number is on this card.
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
Doc!!!  So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
I'm starving.
I know. He's just the best.
I've got Jews at my table.
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
I see the help -- judgement call.
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?
No.
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
His name?
Spencer.
Okay.
So what are you doing with a dog?
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
Sorry.
You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
How old are you?
Oh, please...
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
I'm hungry.  You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
What about your mother?
How do you know about my mother?
Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?
Uh, Udall?
Carol the waitress?
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...
Note. Put it in the note.
Why did yo do this for me?
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
You waiting for me to say something?  What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
What needs clearing up?
I'm not kidding.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
So you'll be at work?
What's this?
Getting loud, getting loud.
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
So. Anything else?
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
Okay.
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
No... no thank you notes.
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
Lovely.
Nice of you... thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What?
I want you to go on this trip.
No, sir...
I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
The stiff one eye?
Two days.
I can't. I work.
You take off when you have to.
My son.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
What's that got to do with it?
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Is there another way to see it?
Hello?
Are you still coming?
Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Hi.
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
I was going to do that for you.
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
Thanks, Melvin.
I'm sure, Simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... But when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.
Nonsense!
Hey -- you let him...
... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.
That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.
Stop asking everyone.
No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
You wanna dance?
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
And?
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
And mean it...
Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.  Baked or fries?
Fries.
I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
Never.
You don't owe me that.
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
Sex with Simon?
It's one idea...
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
I'll never forget you said it.
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?
Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
I don't want to hear that music right now.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
I don't.
This one has a special meaning.
Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
I'll take a bus.
I'll take you... why not?
Hello.
Yeah... Well...
How you doing?
I can trust my brain.
That seems like a good choice.
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
The two might go together.
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
Cute.
Okay to say something now?
Go ahead.
I should've danced with you.
Okay. Good-bye.
What do you want, Melvin?
Were you asleep?
What do you want?
'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
Grouchy?
... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
What job?
Were you asleep?
I wasn't asleep!!
What a break...
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
I had to see you...
Because...
Boyfriend?
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
You know what? I...
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
Yes. I really would.
Well...
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
Was this supposed to be your room?
Can you not be violent?
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
No!!!
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
Uh-huh...
I'm sorry... are you okay?
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
Why? What have you been thinking about?
How to die, mostly.
Good night.
I've got to sketch you.
No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
Stop staring. Do a vase.
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
But what about...
One night with me!
I love you...  Let him take you home.
What the heck are those for?
No. No. Get Carol.
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
What are you trying to do to me?
What the heck do you mean?
Help!
If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
You changed the room around...
I also regrew my beard...  but you're not interested in changes in me... so it's like I always told you...  when it comes to people you...
Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
Hey, hey...  Haaa...  bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they're sure...
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
No touch. No touch. No touch.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
You're taking him...  yes...  you're taking him -- this will clear the books. One night. You want to say "no" to me? Try...  because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying "no."
I'm not saying nothing to you.
Hey, where are you going? You can't do this.  I can't take a dog.  Nobody's ever been in here before.
How's Verdell doing?
Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust...
It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.
Sure -- take him to the vet.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
She's nice.
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
What?
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
Hey -- you called me... I...
About a dog.
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
Good evening.
Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.
What?
Actually, I don't think so.
Shall I get her for you?
How you doing, great one?
No. Please, don't force him.
Sorry. What are those cards?
Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
Terrify me?
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
Frank loves you. You know that... but I've spoken to him and he feels that --  -- as a businessman, with limited resources...
Is he dead yet?
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
Absolutely.
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
Sure thing.
You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
Okay. So you call 911 and don't leave your name -- even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name. How come you make a mistake like that?
How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
What?
Just move on. No one here killed him.
Oh, is he dead?
Ask him.
Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!  Have you seen Verdell?
My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?
Which color was that?
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
How're you doing?
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
Yeeeess!!!
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
Did you... do something to him?
Do you realize that I work at him?
No, I didn't.
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.
It smells like shit in here?
Go away.
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Please, just leave.
Where are all your queer party friends?
Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
Rot in hell, Melvin.
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
Get out.
I carry bacon in my pocket.
Oh, my gosh.
Now we'll both call him.
Come on, sweetheart...
Would you leave now, please?
I brought you Chinese soup.
Thanks.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.
That's very thoughtful.
Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it.
Not it at all, really.
Do you ever get an erection for a woman?
Melvin...
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
You consider your life easy.
I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
What are you talking about? You got real problems.
Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
Another place where?
I told you to go on in.
I think you gotta camp it here...
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
Sorry, didn't know you were awake. I just thought Verdell shouldn't get too used to sleeping in here 'cause then...
You going to come talk to me or not?
What did she say?
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
Because...  ... you love her?
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
Did you like it that much?
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
Picking on me won't help.
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
But you know where you're lucky?
Absolutely not.
You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
What's wrong?
I can't resist. You usually move through here so quickly and I have so many questions I want to ask you. You have no idea what your work means to me.
What's it mean?
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
How do you write women so well?
Exactly what is your previous experience?
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
So you're practically finished, huh?
Wait -- I want to see the painting.
Just a second -- he has to go.
Why are you doing this?
You understand what you'll be doing?
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
Don't say a .
Uh --Mr. Alexander?
What?
Is this dangerous or anything?
No more than the usual.
How much do you usually get paid?
First Lady...
They barely talk anymore.
You're kidding?
Holy cow.
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
Now, remember -- keep it simple.
What's with her?
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
And we're going away for a holiday.
For a month.
A month.
Right and don't embellish.
First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  Alan has put together sort of a training program
I'm not certain about...
Dave...
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
... Alright.
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
Mr. President...
What the hell is this?
The Washington Post.
That shelter was in this bill.
Alan
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
Uh, Mr. President... I don't believe that's on your agenda today.
.. Nothing.
Choices???
What do you think you're doing?!
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
You're nothing.  Do you understand me! You're NOBODY...
I'm... not... nobody...
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
... what?
Oh... I'm fired?
You're fired.
Fine?
Die, you pond scum!
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
I can't believe he'd do this.
Where's the girl?
She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
Nightmare...
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
Don't call the Vice President!
... What?
Just don't call him, Alan!
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
I don't give a shit.
Bob...
Till what?
TilT we figure something out.
Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.
Like how?
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Mild stroke?
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
Up and around?  Soon?
A condition...
We think so.
Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.
I was a senator, you know.
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
I got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred. The older one wanted head of the CDC.
Is that everybody?
Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
What about her.
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
And...
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
Fine.
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
Clean.
I mean I've checked everything. Women.  Liquor... Finances.  I went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
What about the wife?
Clean.
Check his kids.
Clean.
Nobody's got clean kids.
We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
Uh, let me get back to you...
You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
It's a homeless shelter.
Oh.  Excuse me.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
When does it break?
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.
You're kidding.
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
Three years.
No!...  WE didn't anything...
What's with the cameras?
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
Do we have anything on the budget today?
What are you gonna do?
I'm going to kill him.
He's not a President! He's an ordinary person.  I can kill an ordinary person.
Bob...
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
He's only doing what you told him to.
What I told him to?
I heard you.  You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
It's not his job -- It's my job!
Bob...
Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free.  I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!!
Don't do this.
I'll lock him away for good.
What do you mean by that?
Just what you think I mean.
Are you threatening me?
Uh-oh...
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
So you want to go swimming?
Dave -- I'm working.
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
I was gonna do something with Joan.
I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
It's fine.
They could put you in jail.
I don't think so
This is undeclared income.
And who's gonna find out?
The government
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
I'm not sure.
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
Choices?
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
You could buy it on payments.
Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
So what do we do?
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
That'd be great.
You sure?  A Coke or a Perrier or something?
Now, Dave, something has come up and I think we need to talk about it...
Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.
Extend things?
Oh my God...
I know...  I know...  It's difficult for all of us.  But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gQod of the country.
What happened?
It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.
Will he be alright?
No.
I'm afraid so.
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
I'm not sure... I might have.
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America.
In the car?
In the car.
Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first.  You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to...
A teleprompter.
The teleprompter.  Is it hooked up?
I don't think so.
Presence.
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
At a press conference.
What?
Thanks, I wrote it.
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
Dave...
Dave!
I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
Fine.
Gimme a quarter.
What?
President vetoes works bill?
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  Even I don't understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
Let's call it a night.   I can't take any more.
What do you mean you made it all up?
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
This is wrong, Alan!
Wrong...
Alan...
We've got to fix this.
`Dave'?
Now he's making stuff up about me.
Yes, Mr. President?
You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
And it's proving quite effective...
Does it make the cars any better?
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
Perceptual?
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Why?
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
Yes, but I wouldn't...
This is from the people of Burundi...
Oh... Thanks.
What are they?
Fertility beads.
Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
Something like what...
Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
The Fidelity nonsense...
All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
They re not my attack dogs.
What do you mean?
Oh... Hi.
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
Yeah.
... Sometimes they do.
You ever think back to how you started.
What?
One day my wife says to me 'Why don't you try running for office.  You talk about it all the time, why don't you just do it?'  So I tell my boss I have a dentist appointment and I go down to the registrar of voters on my lunch break.  Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.
Really?
How'd you get started?
Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.
You're not?
Your government needs your help.
What?
Really?
We'd like to hire you.
So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?
I can't say.
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
I can't say.
So you just protect the President the whole time?   That's your whole job?
Yeah.
You got a gun?
You ever use it?
No.
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
What about it?
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
Call Bob and Reed.  Tell them I need them immediately.
I was waiting for that jack.
You mean with you and everything?
`Bleed for your king.'
What's that?
First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
You're kidding.
But Bill was your king, not Bob.
Didn't mean to bum you out.
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
Who?
The Vice-President...
Well...
You sure you don't want a lift back home?
I would have taken a bullet for I you, Dave.
What are you staring at?
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
You bet.
Don't you have anything to say to me?
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
What?
I care about the homeless.
... How could I what?
... You know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine.  I can handle it.   But don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.
I don't understand.
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
What's wrong with a magic trick?
Look.  If there was some mistake...
... . Ellen.
I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
Oh... Yeah.
Mind if I sit down?
That was quite a thing you did today.
Anybody would have done it.
Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature.
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
When were you all planning to tell me? A year from now?   After the election...  What's going on here? Dave hesitates.
They asked me to help.
You're leaving?
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
Where are you going?
Where's home?
Just souvenirs.  Towels and stuff.
You1re leaving, too?
How were you gonna get home?
You sure this goes somewhere?
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.
I don't mind.
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
What?
I lock at you and I see Bill...  I mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... I mean, you're right here... alive and...
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
Are you hungry?
What?
I really don't have much of an appetite.
That's a secret.
You have a lot of secrets.
So what do you do the rest of the time?
You mean when I'm not running the country?
Yes.
You know, secretaries and stiff.
You find people jobs?
Yeah.  Is that funny?
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
I know.
It was okay?
Well I guess...
What?
I can't.
I know. I'm sorry...
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
What's wrong?
They're crucifying you out there.
Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
You really believe that?
Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
Yeah.   He's a good man.
Hi.
Hi.
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
I never thought I'd...
I know.
I missed...
So this is it?
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
It could be fun.
I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year.  The `Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet.  We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...
The Monroe?
Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
We're working on it.
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
We're all set,  sir.
What about the intro?
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
Who's this priest I'm thanking?
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
All set.
Yeah, it's in the contract.
... trouser width, this is all classic.  Which means safe, something I'd wear.
I should look different.
And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker?
Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.
What?
Stay, huh?
I honestly wish I could...
You don't miss much.
Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?
Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
Needs salt.
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
Kindred spirits.
He's the salt of the earth.  Kind and loyal and generous.  The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there.
Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
I've lost interest.
Blood oath.
You think...
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
He can't do that to me!
We'll never be the same.
I have a suggestion...
You have no appropriate sense of emergency.  My best friend is ruining his life.
No, he's ruining yours.
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
You have a real philosophy of life.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
I can see why.
Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
You flew all the way h...
I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit.
You like her.
I was devastated.
Go figure you.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
You've been working on this, huh?
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
And you believe that.
He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can.
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
Impressive.
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
The man you love.
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
Someday she'll thank you.

How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
I suppose it's too late to start over.
Two words.
Major.  Dish.
You're going to say it, aren't you?
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
Needing.
Tell him you know this is the worst, dumbest, cruelest moment to do this to him.  But there it is, and he has to choose.
Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning.  Brevity is even more in order than usual.
I did what I came to do.
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that...
Well, we're...
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
Excuse me?
But I can't be dry.
Can you watch the road?
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.
The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  With amazing bodies!
Which was the disqualifying factor?
I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.

That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.

How about...
He sucks soup through his front teeth.
A trademark move, don't touch it.
But he sure can kiss.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
And loving him means loving all of this.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
Let me rephrase that...
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
I'm not joking.  I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em.

And the answer was so simple.
I was gonna predict that.

When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
Don't you see...
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...
In one minute.  You are going to feel so foolish.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
I never want to go through this again.
Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?  As M. of H., you get first fuck.  Don't pick the short, hairy, rich one.
Well.  See.  That was a... reflex to see if it would...
... look good on Kimberly.
I saw the show.
Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
Ex-cuse me?
I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
They both have some growing up to do.  But they're good people, they're starting with love. They've got time.
Is anybody watching?
Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something...
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.
I think he's been fired.
It doesn't say th...
And you think he's kept this to himself.
Maybe.  I should call Ben.
I thought Michael was picking me up.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
Well, you're a little early...
I've been calling for days!
Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...
And she's all wrong for me!
Well, somet...
Well, sure.
But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
Michael, it's Wednesday night, you can't possibly be getting married on Su...
Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt.  That's Frank...
Well, maybe we should talk ab...
Please come, please.
W...
What's the sec...
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
I just admire your maturity, that's all.  I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring.  Day after day, year after year...
Luckily.  The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus.  Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
Such as.
She's too genuine.
Hate that.
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.
Endearingly absent-minded.
Every day.  She makes the bed.
Quite the little eccentric.
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
Waiter! Check, please!
She finds him "personable."
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...
Where was that, Florence, huh?
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
Should I whistle down a cab?
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
What, leaving school...
I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...
I guess you're right.  That would be deceitful... manipulative... controlling... emascula...
Still.  All's fair in love and w...
You're not eating.
I never eat when I'm serene.
You never eat when you're despondent.
Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos were fucking.
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
Wow and wow.  You have a date, after this?
Why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec...
No problem.  A little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society.
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
Big weddings are so strange.
Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.
You miss her, huh?
Don't you throw up on boat?
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.
And I was thinking this could be our last time.  Alone.  Together. You know?
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.
Dance card filled?
Where did we first hear th...
So we heard it... like, right that... that first...
Takes me back.
No accents today.
Will she like it?
It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
I'm up against a deadline.
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
I forgot how cute you look.  When you get impossible.
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?
This thing means that much to y...
The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
Michael? What ha...
Isabelle?  I need to talk to Kim...
"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
What happened?
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
Michael...
No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
Should we take a walk?  Or maybe some food sent up, or something...
Or we'll go somewhere.  If you have the time.
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
This is her family and her fault.
And your point?
Well.  How come she didn't...
I asked you...
Does that make it right...
Thank God you were here.
Oh, yeah.
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
... your one chance for true happiness?
... yeah, that.
The Big Hurt, huh?
What's up?
Jules, what's wrong...
Uh.  I saw that moving...
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that?
Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus that feeds on pond scum.  Lower. The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...
Lower.
Lower.
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
Why would she come here...
I never forgot that.
It's two weeks.
Almost three.
You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain.  Because the only fear she really has, is...
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
Because I could come...
It's not just a gag, huh?
He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...
And to m...
All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
What is that sup...
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
Well, if that's the way you f...
Fine.  I'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m...
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
Kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas, so we figured, give 'em a cheap thrill.  Walter supplied the decorative touches...
Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
... I'm partial to the tight end.
And yet here you are.  All celibate and reclusive.
Maybe it's happy there.
Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you.
Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's marrying the wrong girl.
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
Never mind.  That is so awful that they hide your cars.
What?
Well, do you?
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
How long will they watch us for?
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
: Because he's Guy Perkins.  Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
Thanks.
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
Petty good.
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
College?
What is with this school and prom?
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
What's that?
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
Yeah, I know.
Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
It is?
Yes, it's lame.
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
 uhh, must have forgotten-
Remember, that poet that we liked  the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.
Right. 7:30.
What?
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
Oh, man! Who told?
YOU DID.
Gus, have you ever been in love?
Leave.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
No Roger from op/ed?
Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
You're Pam?
I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
Well excuse me.
Guess who I did it with last night...
Roger in Op/Ed.
Who told!
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
Yeah.
Forget it.
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Anita!
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
You don't think I can do it.
Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
Jos, that's not what we're --
Senorita Josie.
So, you were a geek. Big deal.
Anita, remember espadrilles?
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
Okay. That's bad.
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
Now this is cute.
That is lingerie.
So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
What'd you feel when you kissed him?
Bridgework?
How about this?
Cuuuute!
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
Anita!
Hi!
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
You need my help?
Wow. It's packed.
George! What are you doing here?
What is this?
Hidden camera.
Wings?
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.
Wannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year.
Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.
You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
I think it's pronounced gauche.
Josie, you have totally transitioned.
Transitioned?
: Wait. Do you know any gay guys?
He is totally crunching on you.
Do I want to be crunched?
Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?
Don't tell me... You're Medieval Barbie.
Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.
Well, excuse me for caring about words.
How many times have I fired her?
Five-- Six--
Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
You've done five of my ideas.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
A flack jacket.
A--flack jacket.
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
But I don't want it straightened out.
It's my dad. He worries.  Hi, Dad. I miss you too.
It's an expose on cafeteria food.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."
Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.
Have you been there?
Uhh, no.
Have you been to any parties?
This is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!
Do you even know these kids?
Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
Gus?
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
What if I say no?
That's your story!
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
He's my teacher!
And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!
Oh my god.
Rob's?
Hey there.
Maybe we should go in a different room?
I'm sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we Didn't hit it off right at the beginning but-
Rufus.  But I don't even know where you live.
You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
You having fun?
Hey--what are you thinking about?
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
Oh.
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
God, I can't do this.
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
Hey Rob, what's going on?
That is so--weird that you name your car.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
Better person than I.
See!
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
It's just for a couple of months.
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
Wow. This must be big.
What!?
Do you remember high school?
It was a long time ago -
Josie Grossie.
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
Are mom and dad here?
No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
No, I mean, no big whoop.
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
Is that true?
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
Yes, desperately.
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
Better than I...
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
You're twenty-three years old!
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.
And a gymnast!
Wow, Josie- you look really-
Rufus?
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
Thanks. And what are -
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me?  I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age.
wasn't even thinking about-
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
I-
Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
Whoa. Deja Vu.
Dorothy Parker--
You like her?
I love the way she writes.
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
Sure, why?
Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
Hey, Josie, hold on.  You've been hiding something from me.
Oh I don't think so.
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
Thank you.
So what are you thinking for college?
College. Haven't really thought about it.
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
This seat taken?
Are you--scared?
I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
You remember that story?
Yoooooow.
Okay This is okay. Smooth.  Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
You have to say that. You're my student.
Boys.
I know.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
Why do you do that?
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.
When are you going to open your eyes?
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
Our penguin, right?
Do you think you'll find her?
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
Oh--yikes!
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
Wow. You believe in me that much--
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.
Well, are you here with anybody?
No, I'm alone.
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
You were attracted to me?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
Wait, I was going to tell you--
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
But now you don't have to--
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
Please. Please don't walk away.
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
Yes.
What?
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Why?
I don't know.
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
That is so sad --
Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
Into our group.
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
Josie, you look Rufus.
You ruined the whole thing!
Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
Aloha! Welcome!
Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...
Thank you.  I'm Rob.
Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Well, a ball player.
Are you having fun?
Good. Gibby gave me champagne.
Wow - I-
Hi.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
What do you think of the guinea fowl?
I'm a vegetarian.
Lovely to meet you.
Wait a minute.  What about me?
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
That was such a great evening.
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
Now you're lying.
No!
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
God, that's an enormous arse.
I'm not listening.
No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
And then I... right.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
I'm an actress.
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
Well, they can be.
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
Films mainly.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Fifteen million dollars.
No, thanks.  I'll just look around.
That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money.
Really?
I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.
Sorry about that...
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
Oh Jesus.
Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.
No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
No thanks.
Coffee?
No.
Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?
Really, no.
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
No.
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
Thank you.
Oh hi.  Forget something?
I forgot my bag.
Here we go.
I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
Hello.  Hi.  Hi.
Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
Oh -- Okay.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
Hi.
Hello.
Sorry about not ringing back.  The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.
Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.
Are you busy tonight?
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
Okay -- fine.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
If that's all right.
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
Okay.
You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.
Floppy, huh?
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
Too complicated.
That's fine.
Busy tomorrow?
I thought you were leaving.
Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.
Let's go in.
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
You abide by rules like that?
Whoopsidaisies.
What did you say?
Nothing.
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't.
I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
So who left who?
She left me.
Why?
She saw through me.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
No, you were brilliant
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
I don't know, I'm afraid.
Here we are.  Do you want to come up?
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
You've got to go.
Why?
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  To be honest, I don't realize...
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
Hi.  Can I come in?
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
This is the place.
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
I have thought about you.
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
'Message from command.  Would you like them to send in the HKs?'
'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
Eleven.
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
Cartwright.
'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
My son's name is Johnny?
Yup.
Well, get a message through to him too.
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
What do you think?
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
You think I should do Henry James instead?
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
You like Chagall?
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
With a goat playing a violin.
You've got big feet.
Yes.  Always have had.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
No.  What's that?
The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
You have a stunt bottom?
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
Oh please sod off.
Okay.
Wow.
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
You and every person in this country.
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
Well...
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
Who was Gilda?
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
Can I stay a bit longer?
Stay forever.
What?
Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
Undressed like this, yes.
How are you doing?
How do you think I'm doing?
I don't know what happened.
That's not true.
This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
That's spectacularly unfair.
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
Excuse me?
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
This is certainly... ah...
I only found out you were here yesterday.
It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
But... wait... there are things to say.
Okay.
Hi.
Hello.
You disappeared.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Well... how have you been?
Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
I thought I'd give it to you.
Thank you.  Shall I...
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
You were saying...
But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
Sorry about that.
... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
Yes...
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
Thank you, Bernie.  Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?
Liar.  She hates surprises.  What are you ordering?
I haven't decided.
Excuse me.
Yes.
Can I have your autograph?
What's your name?
What does it say?
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
Is that right?
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
He's bringing a girl?
Miracles do happen.
Does the girl have a name?
He wouldn't say.
That's right.
Where are you going?
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott?
Anna Scott?
Yes.
The movie star?
Yup.
No.  Not true...
I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
... get fired.
No!
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Bella -- this is Anna.
Still loves you though.
In a depressingly asexual way.
I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
Do you want to stay?
Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.
This painting isn't the original, is it?
Bernie.
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
Yes -- sort of...
That's nice.
What?
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
Bloody hell, this is fun.
Hello, Bernie.
Bernie -- this is Anna.
Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers.
Shame!
If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
And we intend to use them!
Is this your first film?
No -- it's my 22nd.
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
Working with Leonardo.
Da Vinci?
Di Caprio.
By the way -- it's you.
Me?
Yes.  What do you think?
I was called and I came.  What's up?
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
What happened?
Hi guys.  Oh holy fuck.
Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
Blimey.  What's that?
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
Well, thanks, that's great.
What do you think?  Good move?
Ahm... room service.
How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
I'll see what I can do.
Still, not sparkling.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
Ah -- no.  It's fine.
What's your name?
I agree.
'Horse and Hound.'  The name's William Whacker.  I think she might be expecting me.
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
The others?
Mr. Thacker?
Yes?
Are you a fan of Henry James?
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
Ah... yes, enormously.
Well, fire away.
Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
I did.
Any bit in particular?
Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.
Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
Cappuccino as ordered.
Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
Would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- I once saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think it was Ringo.  It might have been that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,' Toppy.
Topol.
That's right -- Topol.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
So it could have been neither of them?
I suppose so.
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Right -- want another one?
Martin -- your customer.
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
Max.  This is Anna.
You haven't slept with her, have you?
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
'No comment' means 'yes.'
No, it doesn't.
Do you ever masturbate?
Definitely no comment.
So I get the brownie?
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
Buggered?
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Well?
I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
That's not fair.
Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.
Any more announcements?
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
So -- you've laid the ghost.
I believe I have.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
No, don't think I do.
Oh God no.
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
Hello.
May I help you, sir?
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
Yes, sir.  I have him in my mind.
No, sir.
How about Miss Flintstone?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Can I help you?
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Does she know you're coming?
No, no.  She doesn't.
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
What are the choices?
Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
Cool, huh?
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
There's something wrong with this yogurt.
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
Hey.
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
There's something wrong with the goggles though...
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
So -- any messages?
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Two?  That's it?
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Right.  No one else?
What did she say?
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
Which was?
Try 'Flintstone.'
What?
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?
No, 'fraid not.
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Well, okay.  There's this girl...
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
Oh my God...  Hello.
Spike.
I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
Maybe.
And she's in your house.
Yes.
And you get on very well.
Yes.
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
Spike!
No -- you're right.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
I wouldn't go outside.
Why not?
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.
Was it you?
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
What's going on?
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
Which floor?
Are you sure you...?
Yes.
No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
How was she?
Fabulous.
Excuse me.
Yes.
Bad news.
What?
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
So?
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
What book?
The one down your trousers.
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
He is your husband, no?
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
She was your sister.
No, she wasn't my sister.
Your mother.
Of course not.
Your grandmother?
May I see your boarding pass, please?
I-- I must've misplaced it.
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
You ask what room he's in, okay?
Excuse me?
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
No...  it's just very important that I find him, okay?
Why?
He said he thinks a woman he works with knows him.  Her name's Anna. But she won't be in 'til tomorrow.
So, what's the story with your friend?
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
What for?
No, really.  What's she doing?
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
Were they pen pals?
No.
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
No.
There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  And the last line of it goes, "Who knows?  Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
--separate, in the evening..."
My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
What?...
Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
You're sure...
Good.
Let's find a telephone.
Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.
You're sure...
We found each other, didn't we?
Yes.  We did.
What?
My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
I don't get it.  She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?
She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication".  Like I don't know how to communicate.
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
Who's dying?
Your great aunt.
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
Oh no.  Do you?
I'm a liberal!
No...
There is one other thing you should know about me.
Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
Dwayne?
A very large pig.
Ask her if she knows where he is?
No.
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
...has a prior commitment.
What's mezzaluna?
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here?  Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?
We'll KNOW.
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
Larry, can I borrow your car keys?
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
But, Faith--
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
But Faith--
You...
Hi there...
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
It's an amazing place, don't you think?
Amazing.
Smoking or non-smoking?
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
Hm.
Hello?  Is anybody there?
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
Who's this?
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?
My name's 
Damon Bradley...
WAIT!!  Where are you?
I'm at the airport.  Why?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
Where are you going?
I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
That's not the point.
You said whatever it was you would understand.
How could you do this to me?
I'm in love with you.
You're limping.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
Are you okay?  You want some help?
NO.
Why can't you just tell me?
If it's any of your business, yes.
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
Yes.
To the foot doctor.
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
He's safe.
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
Does he love you?
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
You didn't answer my question.
Why are you asking me this?
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
What?
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
So?
So it wasn't real.
What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
Why not?
I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  So, I called there, they said he left yesterday.  But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route.  He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano.  I called.  And they told me he's checked in.
Where's Positano?
It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
Why?
The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
Uh, I'd rather not say.
Tell me.
I'd really rather not say.
Please.  I need to know.
Mickey Spillane.
Mickey Spillane?
He's out by the pool right now.
Right now?
Do you want me to do it?
Hi, Peter.
So.  You found him.
Well, it looks like we both lucked out.  I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to.
Oh.  That's nice.
And she's a knock-out, too.
Well, good.  Good for you.
Where are you going?  Just-- out of curiosity...
Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.
Hey--
What?
Nice dress.
What?...
What are you doing here?
You were saying...
Say, I saw where they had motor boats for rent down in the harbor. Why don't we all go for an evening cruise around the bay?
Why are you doing this?
I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?
So were you.
Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.
How about music?  You like classical?
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.  Well, was the least I could do.
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
Hi.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
No.  Are you're leaving?
It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.
I know the feeling.
Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
You aren't?
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Well.  Congratulations.
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
Yes.  I am.
You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
Is something the matter?
I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
There's no such thing.
What?
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
Alright.  The truth is... I thought we had something here.
I can't believe you did that!
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
What would you call it?
Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here?   We're talking about love, okay?  Let's be rational.
Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
Very funny.
Really?...
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
I was hoping for the real thing.
You're Damon Bradley?
Hello.
Beautiful place...
Been here long?
Just since yesterday.
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
Tonight?
Any night.
Well, not exactly...
Sure.
I'll look forward to it.
Wait.
Yes?
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
Sure.
You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke.  I could sense the chemistry between us.
Really?
Well, to-- new friends.
Excuse me?
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
What looks good?
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
So what do you think?
Faith, this is my mother.
Oh, hello.
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
So, what are we waiting for?
What?
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
I don't believe in statistics.
What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
No.  He smokes.
How about the other one?  His friend.
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
Scientologist.
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
I don't have an Amana freezer.
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
Is everything okay?
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
But somebody wrote those songs.
So, what's your point?
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
I wish you didn't have to go so early.
No.
Is he married?
No.
Is he gay?
I don't know.  I don't think so.
So?...
What's he do?
I don't know, Kate.
You don't have any idea?
"Thrills"?  That's what you're waiting for?  You know how long that lasts?  Besides, how do you know?  Have you ever been out with him?
No.  He's never asked me.
Why don't you ask him?
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
Yes you did.
Come on, it's not so bad.
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
But what?
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
But one day you wake up and realize you've been had.  Of course life isn't like the movies.  That's why there are movies.
Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.
I know.  You're right.
I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?
Kate, is something the matter?
Larry brought me flowers last night.
Is that bad?...
Have you seen him with someone?
No...  I can just tell.
It's a miracle.
It's a coincidence.
It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
But it's July.
It's still the new year...
What about your job?
I have vacation time coming to me.
You don't have a passport.
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
Because you were afraid to fly.
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
Does Dwayne know about this?
I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
No, I haven't.  And you forgot about the fortune teller.
Thank you so much.
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
Live happily ever after.
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
You okay?
Now what do we do?
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
This is a Lifestyles hotel.
What?
"Of the Rich and Famous".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this.
Are you sure?
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
What are you doing?
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
I just got a dial tone--
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
So?
Ah ha!...
What'd you find?
A Butterfinger wrapper.
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
We're saved!
What is it?
A phone message.  Only--
Only what?
Your brother?
Couldn't we just have taken a train?
I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
I'm hungry.
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
What's that supposed to mean?...
You expecting somebody you know?
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
You think he misses me at all?
'Course he does.
That was a long time ago.
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?
Larry bought himself cologne?
Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--
Her brother.
What did you say to her?
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous.  God, I hate blind dates.  Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
So what's in a name?  I wanna join him.  I don't see why we can't join him.
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
Because I'm the one who's single.
I never even got to be single.
Sure you did.
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
He's heeeeeerrre...
Oh my God.  Where?
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
Is he looking at us?
Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
Faith--
What?
Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
And then what, Faith?
That was really sweet...
I meant about my idea.
I think it's time we got some professional help.
Like a detective.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
Hi-iii...
Hi.  Where've you been?
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Packing.
Why?
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
So, you've had a little bad luck.
A little bad luck?
Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  Children are very impressionable, you know.
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
I know, but...
It was a ouija board, remember?
...and a fortune teller.
Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
What about Peter?...
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
Who said I was going?
What?
No.  No, you go ahead.
You sure you'll be okay?
I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
Peter found him?
Amazing...
Joan Collins stayed here.
Whatareyoudoing?!
What if he doesn't like me?
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
My God... you're right.
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless".
No one's perfect, Kate.
And he is living proof.
Maybe I can change him.
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
He's a jerk.
Yes.  He is.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
Yup.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
So...
Kate is that you?
Uh huh.
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
And Larry?...
What about Larry?
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
And you are?...
Kate.
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
A porco?
Oh.
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
It's siesta.
Oh.
How old are you?
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.
You don't have to go if you don't want to...
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
Giovanni.
Huh?
Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
You miss me?...
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
No, why?
This is the last one before the wedding, right?
Right.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
We're all desperate for the money, doll.  That's what made this country great.  Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
You used to love it when I called you doll.
Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?
What?  You know him?
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
Larry, you've got to tell her.
I came after the woman I love.
Yeah--
She what?!
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
And you didn't tell her?
I have to talk to her.
She's not here.
Where is she?
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
Good strategy.
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
Mania.
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.
Thanks.
What is he up to now?
Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
You don't understand this guy.
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
I'm not running.
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
Right.
Yes.
Ahh.
See you at the wedding.
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
What do you expect me to say to this?
You look awful.
Really?
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
Got any last minute advice?
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
Only respectful things.  What did we have in common back then... What kind of music did you like... Did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...
And what did you say?
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
Good one!  Thanks.
God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Of course.
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
That's it.  Back to obedience school.
And in a "V".
We do it to our dog.
It's hurting.
I'll get the dress.
Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  She's already done this.
Bob's in a hurry.
Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
"Sink the putt."
"Make the shot."
"Nothing but net."
I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.
Rub your ears.
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
-- It's for you, Ike.
What?
Lesson number two.  Never work for your former spouse.
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
No, that's what makes you unemployed.
Lawyers.  I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you.  It's going to be hard to get over.  There will be therapy bills for you.
I already made an appointment for later today.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Fisher, let him talk.
Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?
Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.
Maggie!
Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout.  That's New York living.
... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?
Or a vegetarian?
Look, he's running after her.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
In vino veritas.
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true.  All accurate.
Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
Then you've got it.  If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.
"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play!  Plato never got a book advance...
Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
You're coming here?
Yeah.
Then come for dinner.
Okay, we'll order out.
No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
Of course we are.  Of course.
Then you'll be my best man.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
Get this man a Kamikaze.
You could have told me you were fiance number three.
And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
Thanks.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."
I don't think that's why she ran.
I don't know.  I'm working on it.  I was on the wrong track.
And you defending her?
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
Unbelievable, she got to you.
Sorry, no.  I just got one.
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
I'm not sure.  Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't.  He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her.  I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.
Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is never done.  Mrs. Pressman, thank you.
It's okay.  There's no microphone. You're no fun.
Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
What?
It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
About her upcoming wedding and all.
I am just such a reporter.  And you are?
And you are?
Looking for Maggie.
I think you'd look good in red.
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
It's nice that they're still friends.
Yes, I am.  And who are you?
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
Your two cinnamon rolls.
You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick.
Thank you.
They made me put my hat back on.
Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there.  You don't think they'll call it off...?
Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
Like her mother.
Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...
I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.
Originality is my speciality.
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
Getting nervous?
Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them?
I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...
Did something happen to make you care about reality?
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
You're going to be very disappointed.
We'll see.
That's fair.
Everest.  Is that right?
Twice...
Really?
How romantic.
We think so.
Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.
Give me that!
Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken.
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
Too much.
Seven-fifty.
Five hundred.
Six-fifty.
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
I think so.
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
Maybe someday.
You afraid to try?
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
Always a mood killer.
It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
Highly suspect.
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
I'm a work in progress.
So?  Is that what you said to her?
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
I don't know.
You don't know.
No.
Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.
You look... uh... You look fine.
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
I'll have the same.
Of course.
Tell me.  When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is "King of Blue"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
Can you fix it?
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
Of what?
Kind of isolated.
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
Where did you disappear to?
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?
Excuse me?
Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
Yes.
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
You humiliated me!
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
It's fun!  It's high.
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
That was very interesting research George was doing!
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
I already explained about that.
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
Brian told you that?
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
Lost!
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
What!?
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
That's called changing your mind.
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
Yes I do!
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
I'd rather not.
I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.
About a minute...?
A little longer for me.
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
I love you.  I love you.
To who?  Are you asking me?
Yes, you!
Well, you do have the dress.
And the church.
And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
I'm okay with that.
So am I.
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?
Does it matter?
I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
Yes, I did.
Used?
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
You were not.
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
I'm listening.
Pretty good speech, Maggie.
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
You're a goddess!
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
Reporter?
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
It's probably because you got him fired.
Ya think?
There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
Where?
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
I'm going to kill myself.
Why?
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
But I'm weird.
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
Lighten up, wahine.
Lighten up, what?
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
He's going to be the pastor?
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
What happened at the luau?
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
Grandma!
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
Let's go.
You okay?  I'm closing.
I'm just finishing up, too.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
No, I'm just going to head home.
What are you talking about?
Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
Good boy, Port Hole.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
I'm really rooting for this one.
What?
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
No.  It's my life.
A harmless joke.
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
You tell Maggie.
No, you tell her.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
No.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
Yeah.
There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.
Is there somebody else?
Nope.
You don't love me, is that it?
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
You take the microwave?
What am I going to do with a microwave?
You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
He's got a houseboat.
I hate boats.
It sounds nice.
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
But it's on the water.
It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene --
-- who's married to --
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
Your Uncle Milton lost all his money in a Puerto Rican condominium that went belly up, don't mention the IRS or the Federal prison system.  Your mother is Barbara, your father is Cliff --
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
Am I what they had in mind?
Don't touch them.  I feel terrible sneezing at a time like this.  This is a big moment for me --
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
Is that all right with you?
They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.
I love you.
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
Nope.
Even when you were young?
You sure you don't want to drive with me?
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
I'll wait.
Happy New Year, darling.
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?
Walter, I'd love to --
We'll stay at the Plaza --
Go for a walk in Central Park --
We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
What is it?
It's delicious, trust me.
Does it have wheat in it?
Who is it?
Miss Scarlett.  In the broom closet.  With the radio.
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
That doesn't make any sense.
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
When you get back, I'll be gone --
And then I'll see you in New York --
You go.
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
What?
About forever.
No.
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
You couldn't.
I do.
Walter.
It was my mother's.
Beautiful view, isn't it?
I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --
-- it was a betrayal.
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
So what happened?
I told you.  Nothing --
At the top of the Empire State Building --
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
You okay?
Oh!
What?
You should write something about this.
About what?
It's not true, but it feels true.
What was that about up there?
What was what?
What's with you?
"Sleepless in Seattle"?
That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
Actually, he sounded nice.
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
You're a basket case.
They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
Right.
I should say something in this about magic.
What?
I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
He lost all the weight... there.
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
Can too.
No.
Yes.
And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
Men never get this movie.
I know.
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
Hello.
Turn on your radio!
What?
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
Did you talk to him?
You told a lie and got on a plane.
That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
Becky?
What?
Is this crazy?
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
Thank you.  I love you.
I love you, too.
You were standing in the middle of the street?
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
I love that dream.
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
But he saw you, right?
It's a sign --
You don't know who she was, Annie --
This is a photo of hair.
Becky?
So I mailed your letter.
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
M.F.E.O.?
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
What about the letter?
You're going to miss the train.
No, I'm not. 
What are your plans in New York?
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
I love the symphony.
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
Okay.
She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
No, I know that part --
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
A sense of humor.
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
Honey, he wasn't right for you.
I know.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
Maybe you should see a shrink.
I want my money.
Go home for the weekend.
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
Please --
This is a complete disaster.  I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --
Oh God, it's major.  He's kissing her on the lips.  I have to stop this.
Are you Annie?
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
Howard.
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?
What?
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously.  So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.
I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
It's probably just the flowers --
The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --
Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
Are his folks nice?
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
It's silly, really.  I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.
How amazing.
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
Destiny takes a hand.
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.
What?
You know.
What?
Magic.  It was magic.
Magic.
I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --
Mom!
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Mom, we already...
Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
So you'll get married in a new dress.
It's a sign.
Sure you do.
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...
Magic.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
It's you.
It's me?
Which means --
Great.  This is great.  The whole town knows.  Just out of curiosity, how do you two know?
Grace heard it.
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
Hello.
I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
Who is this?
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.
All righ...
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
It's been about a year and a half.
Have you had any relationship since?
Why not?
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?
What are you going to do, Sam?
What was it that made you know?
I don't think I could really describe it.
Why not?
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
It's not that late in Seattle.
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
You don't like the one he was now?
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
Where's your mom?
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
And you're worried about him.
No.
Why not?
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
Is he home right now?
Yeah.
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
I don't know --
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
How about rapacious and love- starved?
No.
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
It is not --
Hey, my plate is full.
Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda ... She's a weightlifter, but it's not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything --
I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
When's the latest time you were out there?
Seventy... eight.
Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
What's tira misu?
You'll find out.
What is it?
You'll see.
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
You'll like it.
Dad, could you close the door?
Write her.
You think so?
It's Y. O. H.
Yeah.  What's that?
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
I don't get it.
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
Eighty dollars.
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
Window.
Do you want a fruit plate?
I don't know.  Do I?
Dad --
What is it?
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
It's a spice rack.
Dad?  About last night?
It's never happening again. Right?
Not.
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
It plays in 50 states.
What?!
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
Dad, I don't know about this one --
Oh, you're changing your mind --
No, I'm not, but --
What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
Does red pepper go under R or P?
P.  Dad?
What?
I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
Fine.  Fine.
So I can go.
Sure.  Looking good.
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
I'm sorry.  I'm just --
Stressed.
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
How did they get our phone number?
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
Somewhere in the middle.
I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
She looks like my third grade teacher.  I hated my third grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait a minute! She <u>is</u> my third grade teacher!
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
English muffin.  How do you do it?
You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
-- a slice of pizza --
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
It doesn't.  They ask you.
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?
What do you think?
Will she scratch up your back?
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.
Whose show was this on?
Jed's got cables.
Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
I know.
It was sinking.
What was?
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
Bye bye blackbird.
Is that what she used to sing?
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
I don't know.
Like do you believe in heaven?
I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
I'm starting to forget her.
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
This one's for both of us.
Great.
I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 
This is a good letter, Dad.
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
Listen to this --
Not now, Jonah --
Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
Jonah, I'm leaving --
Dad!
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
It's a sign.
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
Why is she bringing that bag?
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
It's only ten o'clock.
Jonah!
Okay.
Thank Victoria for dinner.
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
Don't ever do that again.
What are you doing up?
I was thirsty.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
Did you call that radio station again?
No.
Everyone at work heard you.
I just called for a second.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
It's a short word.
This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
Was Mom an adjustment?
God, she's beautiful.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
Who is Annie?
The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.
Have you seen my wallet?
I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here.  You'll have a swell time.  You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.
Are you going with her?
I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
What's wrong with Annie?
Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me.
This conversation is finished.
You said we could go to New York.
Did not.
Did too.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
Get out.
No.
What if I couldn't get to you?
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
When I found you?
If I didn't go.
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
No.
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
I can't believe you flew first class.
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
Okay.
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.
Do you like baseball?
Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
What about camping?
What about it?
Do you like it?
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
Well...
Hi.
Hi.  Sam?
Yes?
We live two piers over, don't we? Number 12, right? We're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by.
Thanks, but... we've got plans.
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
You saw her in the airport and then here?
How's Jonah taking it?
It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
You're kidding --
It's a little derivative.
What do you mean?
Anyway, Victoria's nice.
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
Hi.
You look good.
I thought you were never going to call me.
You did?
I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
You could have called me --
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
Oh.
We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
Is he there?
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
He's ten.
He's good at it.
I read an article about this ...
I read the same article...
It takes time --
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
You know what I love about all this?
Theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Perfect. All ginny.
Except its Scotch.
Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
Christ, Amy.
Oh, shut up and be happy. Its always this or that. Youre never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
Why dont you get my half sister her seventh hole?
I dont think I can go through with this.
Pub Golf?
Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Dont worry about it.
God, Kat! Please. Dont be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
I should get going.
Are you sure youre okay?
We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.
So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
Hey.
You know what? Im not having this conversation right now.
Wow. You look beautiful.
Fred Astaire and whats her face!
Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me.
What for?
You know all that if these walls could talk stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?
It was such a long time ago.
Still--
If Ed ever found out....
Or Kat....
Youd better get going. My parents will be round to cart you off to the country.
Whatever you do, dont mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
Say something. Please.
Does Kat know?
Jeffrey told her last night.
Wheres Nick sleeping?
Why, with you.
Huh?
Moms refining her strategy for DDay.
Im sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
Id be happy to. Youre welcome.
I blame Tony Pee-Pants!
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet.
Im an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I dont bake.
Whats going on with you two?
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now shes getting married.
Theres a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldnt split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
Mom, please.
Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasnt just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
She did?
Whos ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly?
Um, just about everyone.
Just because some slags been paid for, doesnt mean youve got to...you know.
I think I love you, mate.  How do you know so much about so much?
I thought you said you were crap.
I had to say something to get you here.
Ill just check into a hotel.
I look like a total wanker, dont I?
You heading to the train station?
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
Whats his problem?
What?
Theres something about him thats just a bit odd.
Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
No.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
And Kat was fully clothed.
But, somehow, it was Kats arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
Thats when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Oh, shut up. Youre an optician.
I didnt deserve her back then.
Nothing.
Hey.
Ah, a philosopher.
Shrink, actually.
Crikey.
What?
Nothing, nothing.
No, tell me.
Hey, man.
Sorry, can you give us a moment?
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
Seeing you again....
Hey, Kat.
Hey, you!
Let me guess. Amy presumed Id forget the rings.  I think Im her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
So, tell me, hows unmarried life?
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, were the past. Im not sure if you noticed, but Im here with someone else.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, theres something not quite right.
Its called character. God, youre predictable.
Kat, wait. I dont want you hating me. Weve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.
Um, news flash: I dont give a shit.
That was a long time ago.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
So, whats your point?
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Right. Seven.  Christ, thats a long time, isnt it?
Not for a dog.
Is this supposed to be an apology?
Youre not even listening.
Bollocks, Im sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Its no big deal. I promise.
Brilliant.
Its the past. Its nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then lets go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
Im sorry?
Hi. Hey.
You think we look like were trying too hard.
What color are my shoes?
Dont patronize me. Theyve clearly been at this a while.
Youre funny.
Mission accomplished.
Mmm.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when theyre naked.
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macram.
He was pretty drunk, but I think hes still crazy about you.
What did he say exactly? I mean, you dont think he wants me back?
I dont know.
What does your gut say?
No, count it, anyway.
Why?
Six thousand, right?
On the nose.  I tell you what, because youre so cute, Ill take care of our incidentals.
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
That wont be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
You quitting?
Who are they?
What?
Its cute.
What is?
You stand on your tiptoes.
Have you ever done anything like this before?
A weekend?
Not the way youre thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that.
Not you. Youre not disgusting. Youre lovely. Just the idea that theyd bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didnt...who never.... I mean, someones dead.
Sorry. Im a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
This happened to you?
How did you know that was me?
I have a friend at the magazine.
Your friend guaranteed my anonymity.
Would you grab my shampoo?
The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.
Oh, no.
You shit!
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
And you thought Id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.
Yes.
What?!
Are you asking me if Im gay for pay?
I guess so.
Theres a guy on 81st and Madison. You get your results in 24 hours.  Do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them?
I love that youre asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?
Dont stop asking questions, okay?
I swear. I dont have a signature move.
Subtle?
Its hard to explain.
Come on.
Are you sure?
Is this for last night?
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
Dont they have a limit at those machines?
So youre telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? Thats a down payment on a Ford Focus!
And what if I didnt want you to...to do that to me?
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
What?
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
But nothing did.
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. Its all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, youre not walking away!
Oh, cut the crap!
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
Im sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
You have had girlfriends?
When I said Id never done a wedding before, I didnt say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
So, whyd you say yes to me?
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?
Yeah. You?
Fourteen and hes hoodwinked by a an erector set?
And thats when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
Besides, you hired me for my discretion.
Youve always got that to hide behind, dont you? Its just business!
You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I dont know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. Its your job. Its who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
Youre right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
Hi.
I should go.
What?! No, no. You cant--
Nice speech. I thought it was touching... and funny.
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You havent visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
You have more than one gynecologist?
You didnt have to do that.
Whats he do anyway?
Like fifteen.
Oh, no. He told you.
You knew?
Hey, Sal.
I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. Youre here for the highland flings, I bet.
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?
Give it back? Are you nuts?
You pawned it.
You want I nut him in the boat?
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
You want me to let him in?
Dad!
Hi, kiddo.
Thats not true. We checked for leaks a few years back.  Good morning.
So whyd you let him go?
Its complicated, Dad.
Yeah.
Im worried. Amys not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it drunker or drunker-er?
Not yet...
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?
I always wondered what happened with us.
Shes drunk. -er than me. But I didnt really dump you, did I?
Im guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.
I am now, sir.
What is it you do again?
What do you say to that?
Best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass--
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
